# cmpt310A2

Show how search can be used to solve this problem, using the variable ordering A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. To do this, you should write a program to

1. draw the search tree generated (see below)
2. report all solutions (models) found
3. report the number of failing consistency checks (i.e. failing branches) in the tree
You can use whatever programming language you like.

To draw the search tree, write it in text form with each branch on one line.
